Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

What did you do particularly well?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?

Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How do you approach designing software?

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?



The DriverPass project consists of a web application that provides customers and internal staff with the ability to create and edit driver training appointments.
The client was a company by the same name. If given more time I could improve on my Activity Diagram. I feel that I left some details out. I think I did a good job understanding the scope of the system and the components needed to architect the system. It is important to consider the users' needs when implementing the system as it will be the users and their interaction with the system that ultimately determine if the project is successful. If the system is not considered adequate by the users it is considered incomplete or a failure. When designing software I spend time working with the end users to identify the problem that we are looking to solve. From there a planning phase occurs. It is here that we also identify scope, budget, and resources to level-set the proper expectations. In the future I would study similar systems to understand how the industry typically solves similar challenges. Often it will discovered that there is a similar system that can be used in the modeling process.
